Any idea on how to increase the speed of testing guys?

I just added a single unit test, and for each little modification, I need to wait 20 second for the compilation to finish.


[02/24/2024 14:08] inimys
How are you testing?


[02/24/2024 14:08] inimys
I mean are you running all tests at once, or just match testing?


[02/24/2024 14:24] al_qa_qa
I made the test myself, to understand how the invariants changes on action


[02/24/2024 14:30] mctoady
you can forge test --mt $TEST_NAME, but unsure if that will cut down on compile time


[02/24/2024 14:32] al_qa_qa
I do this, and it takes 10 seconds now. IDK why it takes that long. I noticed this problem recently.


[02/24/2024 15:21] tychaios.

I've answered all the private questions I've received. Let me know if there are any others here.

By the way, looks like the installation of the `uniswap/v3-core` and the `uniswap/v3-periphery` dependencies may not have translated properly to the codearena repo. You may have to forge install each. And your remappings in `foundry.toml` should look like this:

```
  remappings = [
    "openzeppelin/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts/contracts",
    "uniswap-periphery/=lib/v3-periphery/contracts",
    "@uniswap/v3-core=lib/v3-core",
  ]
```

[02/24/2024 19:55] bendifran
As others have mentioned, to reduce test times, use `--mt`, `--mp`, or `--mc` to match the test, test file, or test contract you want to run specifically. The invariant tests take a while to run, as do the integration tests. The integration tests will make a lot of RPC calls. Other tests should be pretty quick and don't make RPC calls.


[02/24/2024 20:08] forgebyola

They're verified in the ERC20 Permit function itself (think $UNI's might be slightly different but with same functionality)

Going as rewards as reward tokens 
Maybe thus part i can be wrong


[02/25/2024 09:22] nmirchev8
So if the 'enableFeeAmount' is called, this would be charging X amount fee for Uni stakers for the give tick spacing for all pools, which 'fee' goes to LPs


[02/25/2024 10:14] forgebyola
Is the REWARD_RECEIVER not basically the unistaker contract? or would it be different

Hi @bendi , @Keating, @wildmolasses! Unfortunately the [DelegationSurrogate](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-uniswap-foundation/blob/main/src/DelegationSurrogate.sol) submitted to the competition is obviously incomplete; e.g. it doesn't include the implementation of the `permit` function, used e.g. [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-uniswap-foundation/blob/5298812a129f942555466ebaa6ea9a2af4be0ccc/src/UniStaker.sol#L301). Could you please confirm that using smth. like [this gist](https://gist.github.com/kuprumion/0210543da989b282b7d02cf6d14f6007) instead of `DelegationSurrogate` is fine, in particular for making PoCs, or could you please otherwise provide a source code of your own which makes the codebase complete? Thanks!


[02/27/2024 13:53] yixxas
We know that `STAKE_TOKEN` here is UNI. So the `permit` implementation would simply be the one used by UNI.


[02/27/2024 14:06] kuprumion
Ok, then I would like to get the confirmation from the sponsors that the deployed UNI source code is the one that should be used in the competition; or alternatively a link to the Github commit with the source code.


[02/27/2024 14:21] mctoady
Yes the token for uniswap staking will be the uniswap token


[02/27/2024 14:28] bendifran
Yes the Staking Token will definitely be UNI


[02/27/2024 14:28] al_qa_qa
I think there is a misunderstanding @kuprum, I will try to illustrate as good as I can. And ofc the sponser can correct the wrong parts.

- Surrogate usage is only for holding UNI tokens, not else. But why should we do such a thing and lock our tokens?
- The UNI ERC20 token is a Vote token, simply it is used in Gvernance.
- In Order to participate in the Governance your tokens are not calculated instead your voting power
- What is voting power? voting power is given to the address you `delegate` to
- So the UNI token holder is not important, all we care about is the voting power.
- When staking, you provide the `delegate` address, which will have the voting power of ther tokens you staked
- Sothat you can participate in Governance using this  `delegate` adderess
- And UNI tokens locked in the `surrogant`, you will take them back when `withdrawing`.
- Why implementing such a pattern? This pattern is used in governance and Vote tokens to be safe for Vote token holders. As the Holder will be an address (surrogant contract), what can not transfer his tokens by itself. only the Unistaker can do this when `withdrawing`.

The proposed rewards token is WETH though that is not 100% guarranteed


[02/27/2024 14:30] bendifran
Yes this is basically correct. The purpose of the surrogate contract is just to delegate and hold tokens, it's needed because of the way UNI delegation is designed.

[02/27/2024 18:37] aamirusmani1552
previous audit report public yet?


[02/27/2024 19:54] tychaios.
Not sponsor but it's because they want to limit what the owner can do over the factory, in this setup FactoryOwner will be able to call some setters and that's it so the DAO can be the admin of the factory owner and still adjust some stuff

{Reactions}
üëç 

[02/27/2024 20:41] bendifran
As @Tychai0s explains, we want the contract as the owner so we can define specific rules around how it can interact with the factory. Also please open a private thread if you have a question, as opposed to direct DM.

why there is a need of altering delegate?


[02/29/2024 07:12] aamirusmani1552
To transfer your voting power to some other address if that's what you asking.


[02/29/2024 07:14] 0xaman.
thanks for you response . why there is need to alter delegate


[02/29/2024 07:23] aamirusmani1552
Because when you stake tokens, you loose your voting power. That is why when you stake in the `UniStaker`, your tokens will be transferred to the `DelegationSurrogate` contract of the corresponding `delegatee` address. And this `DelegationSurrogate` will transfer the voting power to the `delegatee` so that he can vote. 

This `delegatee` can be any address or your own address as well. You can always change this by using `alterDelegatee()` function.

Who recieves the fees from the pool 
The person who pays for them ?


[03/01/2024 13:23] aamirusmani1552
Yes. Someone will send a particular amount of reward tokens set in payout amount and in return will be able to get back the fees accrued in a pool.

if searcher or MEVs send reward token to claim Pools fee , so what's liquidity provider gets instead, cause they don't receive any commission anymore right?


[03/01/2024 23:27] guy_in0xnito
Can there be more than one delegate or beneficiary for a account?


[03/01/2024 23:38] forgebyola
I believe there can be for each of the different deposits an account has


[03/01/2024 23:39] forgebyola
Each deposit/stake may have it's own delegate and beneficiary


[03/02/2024 00:04] guy_in0xnito
Can the sponsors please confirm this ,!


[03/02/2024 00:06] mctoady
one address can create multiple deposits, with different deposit ids
each deposit can specify their own delegatee/beneficiary

[03/02/2024 07:41] sean3416
Any buddy can help me understand this? `/// @notice A dead-simple contract whose only purpose is to hold governance tokens on behalf of
/// users while delegating voting power to one specific delegatee. This is needed because a single
/// address can only delegate its (full) token weight to a single address at a time. Thus, when a
/// contract holds governance tokens in a pool on behalf of disparate token holders, those holders
/// are typically disenfranchised from their governance rights.`


[03/02/2024 07:41] sean3416
I dont quite get it --- if the UniStaker do not create a surrogate for each delegatee, instead it just keep the deposited UNIs in itself but it does the accounting well, then how it will lead to "those holders are typically disenfranchised from their governance rights." ??


[03/02/2024 07:50] sean3416
I don't get the part "disenfranchised from their governance rights" --- what can be the situation it is referring to?


[03/02/2024 08:25] mctoady
basically:

in traditional staking systems, you have to choose between staking the tokens or voting withthem in governance, because all the staked tokens are intermingled in one contract.

UniStaker uses the surrogate contract so each contract is only holding the delegated stake (voting power) of a certain address, so tokens can be staked without losing their ability to vote with those tokens

{Reactions}

[03/02/2024 08:38] sean3416
Thank you for the reply~ one more thought: what if the tokens are staked in one contract but the numbers are well accounted (delegatee => amount), then are the staked tokens in one place still considered "intermingled"?


[03/02/2024 08:52] mctoady
If you built your own governance contract that queried the staking contract to calculate voting power it would probably be possible to delegate without using surrogates. However Uniswap's delegating logic (in the $UNI contract) is set up to delegate the entire balance of an address to the delegatee, so the surrogate contracts are required to get around this

{Reactions}
thankyou 

[03/02/2024 09:08] sean3416
Ah, neat. I saw the UNI code of _delegate(), now I understand the comments. Thx 4 ur help~

An unusual question to ask; 
If my deposit ID is 1 and I want to stakeMore and requires passing the deposit ID (in test), any idea how to pass this, since it‚Äôs involves deposit Identifier or sort..? @visualbits , @nmirchev8 , @Al-Qa-qa  any idea on this?


[03/03/2024 10:30] aamirusmani1552
stake function returns depositId of type depositIdentifier


[03/03/2024 10:30] al_qa_qa
You can initialze the value as 
```
UniStaker.DepositIdentifier id = 1
```


[03/03/2024 10:31] superman_i4g

100 weth is a realistic rewards amount at some point in time? Anyone?


[03/04/2024 06:55] mctoady
I believe the example in the docs uses 10 WETH as an example, 100 might be a bit steep but cant confirm


[03/04/2024 06:59] pfapostol
The size of the reward depends on how much fee is accumulated in the controlled pools. and can be settled via government timelock


[03/04/2024 07:06] mangoeth
Right, it implies that anyone claims when they see the opportunity of profit in the value of both assets with the  weth they have to provide for it. Assuming weth is the reward token. 
The reward notification in the staking contract cant be called for micro deposits tho, but rather decent amounts in right time intervals, from what i understand.


[03/04/2024 07:07] mangoeth
Thank you for the reminder, had a vague number in mind but wasnt shure if it was 10 or 100. üëç


[03/04/2024 08:23] forgebyola

Maybe the sponsors' "design choices" should be made clear to audit participants in upcoming audits

I have no findings but as I see situation is interesting. So can someone in explain what is happening?
As I understand, there was 3 H, but UniStaker didn't take them because they think it's not valid? And because that Code4rena need to pay UniStaker because no one found any valid bugs or what?

[03/27/2024 06:40] jvorex
same there was no point in arguing. First pass my qa survived so I thought yeah grade be then second pass nah. I think some good ones got grade c because initially it seemed the mediums would be acceptable and a lot of those good attack vector mediums were downgraded to Grade B so needs to make some room

This is crazy, QA submission gets 7k payout, I know bcz no HM found, still a crazy thing.

[03/28/2024 08:36] alexfilippov314
Hi! Could someone please assist me in understanding something? I believe I submitted an issue (among some others) with recommendations that were implemented in these PRs: https://github.com/uniswapfoundation/UniStaker/issues/66, https://github.com/uniswapfoundation/UniStaker/issues/67. It seems a bit strange to me that I don't see my name on the list. I just want to confirm that there is no mistake.

Issues are visible in the repo that is in Code4Rena GitHub account, not UniSwapFoundation Original Repo.

You can access this repo once the report is published


[03/28/2024 09:05] alexfilippov314
Thank you, I understand it. I mean that it is a bit strange that the protocol implemented recommendations from one of my issues right after the contest but I'm not mentioned on the list. Once the report will be published confirming whether it was a mistake is kind of late üôÇ


[03/28/2024 09:07] alexfilippov314
I don't have backstage access yet btw, so I can't verify it by myself


[03/28/2024 09:34] saint6704
congrats ser


[03/28/2024 10:24] al_qa_qa
1. Since no HM, you need to have a QA grade B at least or Analysis Grade B at least to be on the list.
2. The sponser can confirm an issue that marked as Invalid in the contest.


[03/28/2024 10:25] al_qa_qa
Thanks alot sir ü´°


[03/28/2024 10:58] alexfilippov314
Thank you again, but I am already aware of that. I'm not trying to question the correctness of the judgment or anything. I just want to eliminate the human factor and confirm that it is not a mistake, as I am not able to do it myself.


[03/28/2024 11:02] al_qa_qa
I think it is not a mistake, as Sponsers can reference any issue submitted by any warden in the contest in his main repo.
